# AGRIGROW 


"A ML based webapp that recommends the best crop to grow, fertilizer to use 
and plant disease prediction"


## PURPOSE
• The purpose of the “Agrigrow” is to clearly articulate the challenges and 
shortcomings in current agricultural practices that the proposed machine 
learning-based web application aims to address.

• It serves to highlight the specific issues faced by farmers, such as 
suboptimal crop yields, inefficient fertilizer usage, and challenges in 
timely disease detection. 

• By outlining these problems, the statement establishes a compelling 
rationale for the development of the intelligent crop management 
system.

## DATA SOURCE
- [Crop recommendation dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset)

- [Fertilizer suggestion dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gdabhishek/fertilizer-prediction)

- [Disease detection dataset]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset)

- [PLANT DISEASE MODEL FILE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RmavJJ06sjeaO-tkRchBoZvjfpMNlYVn/view?usp=drive_link)
## 🛠 BUILT WITH
• Pandas
• Matplotlib
• NumPy
• Seaborn
• Scikit-learn
• TensorFlow
• Keras
• streamlit




## HOW TO USE
1> crop prediction : enter the paramters value of your soil and weather condition and as per that it suggest the best crop to grow.

2> fertilizer prediction : enter the nutrient contents of your soil and as per that it suggest the best fertilizer for your crop.

3> disease prediction : Upload an image of leaf of your plant. The algorithm will tell the crop type and whether it is diseased or healthy. 
## HOW TO RUN
1> save all the file in same location [D drive]

2> set the path of your pickle file in agriwebapp.py file in spyder ide

3> after that save the file 
 
4> open ananconda prompt 

5> set the path [cd /d D:]

6> type streamlit run agriwebapp.py

7> webappp will open after few seconds
